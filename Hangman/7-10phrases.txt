There are only five students here today
She said hello to the little girl
The baby drank milk and fell asleep
I opened my computer and sat down
The boy took the bus to school
My friend called me late last night
Lets go to the park and play
I can see a yellow lemon tree
I wanted to join the people playing soccer
The girl over there gave me lunch
The angry bee says to buzz off
This dog is brown and covered in spots
My cat likes to sleep on my bed
My friend is obsessed with playing video games
The coffin was lowered into the ground slowly
The human sat still while the robot painted
The sunglasses fell off his head and cracked
Why are there so many bugs and stuff
How do you make a dog stop barking
Please stop in the name of the law
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
Why are there so many mosquitos on the earth
The stairs creaked every time he stepped on them
The ice cream slowly melted in the hot sun
The rain fell quickly and ruined the marvelous painting
The superhero used his powers to defeat the villain
I forgot to turn in the assignment due today
This keyboard is dirty and needs to be cleaned
A book report on a dictionary would be boring
A small bean once said to eat good food
The gardener liked to plant their seeds in the winter
My great grandmother has a house somewhere on the planet
I will try to work hard so I dont fail
His brother said that he couldnt climb over the wall
My brother tried to fly and jumped off our roof
Objects in the mirror are often closer than they look
Im alone and almost asleep when someone opens my door
Halloween is a time for kids to get free candy
The large volcano erupts and spews lava and ash plumes
The restaurant owner sadly realized that he doesnt make enough money
